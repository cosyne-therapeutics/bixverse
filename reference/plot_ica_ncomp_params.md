# Plot various parameters with no comp

Helper function to plot various parameters with the no of components.
You have:

- Median stability - The median stability of the clusters at this no of
  components given random initialisations.

- % Converged - The percentage of ICA runs that converged at this no of
  components.

- IC Orthogonality - The orthogonality (measured as `1 - abs(cos)`)
  indicating how orthogonal the signals detected at this level are.

- Combined score - The product of the three other scores.

If found, the function will also add the optimal number of components
based on
[`ica_optimal_ncomp()`](https://gregorlueg.github.io/bixverse/reference/ica_optimal_ncomp.md)
(if a loess function could be fitted).

## Usage

``` r
plot_ica_ncomp_params(object)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  The class, see
  [`BulkCoExp()`](https://gregorlueg.github.io/bixverse/reference/BulkCoExp.md).
  You need to apply
  [`ica_evaluate_comp()`](https://gregorlueg.github.io/bixverse/reference/ica_evaluate_comp.md)
  before running this function.

## Value

The plot with no comp ~ vs. various parameters.
