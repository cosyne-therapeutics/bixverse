# Iterate through Leiden resolutions for graph-based community detection.

This function will identify gene modules based on affinity graphs from
the single correlation or differential correlation methods. Briefly, in
the case of single correlation, the graph is generated based on the
absolute correlation coefficients that are subjected to a Gaussian
affinity kernel. This reduces spurious correlations and leaves a
sparsely connected graph. In the case of differential correlations, the
graph is generated based on significant differential correlations if one
of the two correlations reached the defined minimum thresholds.  
Subsequently, Leiden community detection is applied on the respective
graph through a range of resolutions that the user can define. The
function then returns meta information about the resolutions (which can
also be plotted) to identify the best suitable resolution parameter to
identify co-expression modules.

## Usage

``` r
cor_module_graph_check_res(
  object,
  resolution_params = params_graph_resolution(),
  graph_params = params_cor_graph(),
  random_seed = 123L,
  min_genes = 10L,
  parallel = TRUE,
  max_workers = NULL,
  .verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  The class, see
  [`BulkCoExp()`](https://gregorlueg.github.io/bixverse/reference/BulkCoExp.md).

- resolution_params:

  List. Parameters for the resolution search, see
  [`params_graph_resolution()`](https://gregorlueg.github.io/bixverse/reference/params_graph_resolution.md).
  Contains:

  - min_res - Float. Minimum resolution to test.

  - max_res - Float. Maximum resolution to test.

  - number_res - Integer. Number of resolutions to test between the
    `max_res` and `min_res.`

- graph_params:

  List. Parameters for the generation of the (differential) correlation
  graph, see
  [`params_cor_graph()`](https://gregorlueg.github.io/bixverse/reference/params_cor_graph.md).
  Contains:

  - Epsilon - Defines the epsilon parameter for the radial basis
    function. Defaults to 1, but should be ideally optimised.

  - min_cor - Float. Minimum absolute correlation that needs to be
    observed in either data set. Only relevant for differential
    correlation-based graphs.

  - fdr_threshold - Float. Maximum FDR for the differential correlation
    p-value.

  - verbose - Boolean. Controls verbosity of the graph generation.

- random_seed:

  Integer. Random seed.

- min_genes:

  Integer. Minimum number of genes that should be in a community.

- parallel:

  Boolean. Parallelise the Leiden clustering.

- max_workers:

  Optional Integer. Number of cores to use if parallel is set to `TRUE`.
  If set to `NULL` it will automatically detect the number of cores.

- .verbose:

  Controls the verbosity of the function.

## Value

The class with added data to the properties.
