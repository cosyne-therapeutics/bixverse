# Load in Seurat to `SingleCells`

This function takes a Seurat file and generates `SingleCells` class from
it.

## Usage

``` r
load_seurat(
  object,
  seurat,
  sc_qc_param = params_sc_min_quality(),
  batch_size = 1000L,
  streaming = TRUE,
  .verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  `SingleCells` class.

- seurat:

  `Seurat` class you want to transform.

- sc_qc_param:

  List. Output of
  [`params_sc_min_quality()`](https://gregorlueg.github.io/bixverse/reference/params_sc_min_quality.md).
  A list with the following elements:

  - min_unique_genes - Integer. Minimum number of genes to be detected
    in the cell to be included.

  - min_lib_size - Integer. Minimum library size in the cell to be
    included.

  - min_cells - Integer. Minimum number of cells a gene needs to be
    detected to be included.

  - target_size - Float. Target size to normalise to. Defaults to `1e5`.

- batch_size:

  Integer. If `streaming = TRUE`, how many cells to process in one
  batch. Defaults to `1000L`.

- streaming:

  Boolean. Shall the data be streamed during the conversion of CSR to
  CSC. Defaults to `TRUE` and should be used for larger data sets.

- .verbose:
