# Calculate VISION pathway scores in Rust with auto-correlation

The function will take in a list of gene sets that contains lists of
`"pos"` and `"neg"` gene indices (0-indexed). You don't have to provide
the `"neg"`, but it can be useful to classify the delta of two stats
(EMT, Th1; Th2) etc. Additionally, it will take a random gene list and
calculate an auto-correlation score based on Gaery's C to identify
pathways that show significant patterns on the kNN graph generate on the
provided embedding.

## Usage

``` r
rs_vision_with_autocorrelation(
  f_path,
  embd,
  gs_list,
  random_gs_list,
  vision_params,
  cells_to_keep,
  cluster_membership,
  streaming,
  verbose,
  seed
)
```

## Arguments

- f_path:

  String. Path to the `counts_cells.bin` file.

- embd:

  Numerical matrix. The embedding matrix to use to generate the kNN
  graph.

- gs_list:

  Nested list. Each sublist contains the (0-indexed!) positive and
  negative gene indices of that specific gene set.

- random_gs_list:

  Double-nested list. The outer list represents the clusters of clusters
  and the inner list represents the permutations within that cluster.

- vision_params:

  List. Contains various parameters to use in terms of the kNN
  generation.

- cells_to_keep:

  Integer. Vector of indices of the cells to keep.

- cluster_membership:

  Integer. Vector that indicates to which of the permuted gene set
  clusters the given gene set belongs.

- streaming:

  Boolean. Shall the data be streamed.

- verbose:

  Boolean. Controls verbosity of the function.

- seed:

  Integer. Random seed for reproducibility.

## Value

A list with the following items:

- autocor_res - Auto-correlation results, i.e., 1 - C, p-value and FDR.

- vision_mat - A matrix of cells x vision scores per gene set.
