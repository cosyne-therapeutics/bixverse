# Calculate the information content for each ontology term

this function will calculate the information content of each provided
term based on a list of ancestors, which is a named list of terms with
ancestor identifiers as their values. Can be calculated using
[`get_ontology_ancestry()`](https://gregorlueg.github.io/bixverse/reference/get_ontology_ancestry.md).
The information content is calculated as
`-log2(number descendant/total terms in the ontology)`. More information
