# Run hypergeometric enrichment a list of target genes over the gene ontology

This function implements a Rust version of the gene ontology enrichment
with elimination: the starting point are the leafs of the ontology and
hypergeometric tests will first conducted there. Should the
hypergeometric test p-value be below a certain threshold, the genes of
that gene ontology term will be removed from all ancestors. This
function is designed to leverage Rust-based threading for parallel
processing of a list of target genes. WARNING! Incorrect use can cause
kernel crashes. Wrapper around the Rust functions with type checks are
provided in the package.

## Usage

``` r
rs_gse_geom_elim_list(
  target_genes_list,
  levels,
  go_obj,
  gene_universe_length,
  min_genes,
  elim_threshold,
  min_overlap,
  fdr_threshold
)
```

## Arguments

- target_genes_list:

  A list of target genes against which to run the method.

- levels:

  A character vector representing the levels to iterate through. The
  order will be the one the iterations are happening in.

- go_obj:

  The gene_ontology_data S7 class. See
  [`gene_ontology_data()`](https://gregorlueg.github.io/bixverse/reference/gene_ontology_data.md).

- gene_universe_length:

  The length of the gene universe.

- min_genes:

  number of minimum genes for the gene ontology term to be tested.

- elim_threshold:

  p-value below which the elimination procedure shall be applied to the
  ancestors.

- min_overlap:

  Optional minimum overlap threshold.

- fdr_threshold:

  Optional fdr threshold.

## Value

A list containing:

- go_ids - The gene ontology identifier.

- pvals - The calculated odds ratios.

- fdrs - The calculated fdrs.

- odds_ratios - The calculated odds ratios.

- overlap - The size of the overlap.

- gene_set_lengths - The length of the gene sets.

- no_test - The number of tests for that target set that passed the
  thresholds.
