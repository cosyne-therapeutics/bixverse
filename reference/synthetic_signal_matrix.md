# Generates a simple synthetic, pseudo gene expression matrix

This is a function to create a synthetic, pseudo gene expression matrix
with a pre-defined number of total genes, groups and number of genes
differentially expressed in the groups. The function will create in a
standard setting a 1000 x 90 matrix, and add optionally a small group
into the mixture that is slightly more difficult to detect

## Usage

``` r
synthetic_signal_matrix(
  no_grps = 3,
  per_group = 30,
  total_genes = 1000L,
  no_genes_up = 100L,
  add_small_group = TRUE,
  size_small_grp = 5L,
  seed = 10101L
)
```

## Arguments

- no_grps:

  Integer. Number of initial larger groups. Default: 3L.

- per_group:

  Integer. Number of samples per larger groups. Default: 30L.

- total_genes:

  Integer. Number of total genes in the matrix. Default: 1000L.

- no_genes_up:

  Integer. Number of genes per group that are differentially expressed.
  Default: 100L.

- add_small_group:

  Boolean. Add a smaller group that overlaps with group 1? Default:
  TRUE.

- size_small_grp:

  Integer. Size of the smaller group.

- seed:

  Integer. Initial random seed for generation of the synthetic data.
  Default: 10101L.

## Value

A `synthetic_matrix_simple` class containing:

- mat - The random matrix

- diff - List of differentially expressed genes per group

- group - Look-up vector for sample to group mapping

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
synthetic_GEX <- create_synthetic_signal_matrix()
synthetic_signal_mat <- synthetic_GEX$mat
} # }
```
