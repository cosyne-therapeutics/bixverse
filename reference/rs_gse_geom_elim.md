# Run hypergeometric enrichment over the gene ontology

This function implements a Rust version of the gene ontology enrichment
with elimination: the starting point are the leafs of the ontology and
hypergeometric tests will first conducted there. Should the
hypergeometric test p-value be below a certain threshold, the genes of
that gene ontology term will be removed from all ancestors. WARNING!
Incorrect use can cause kernel crashes. Wrapper around the Rust
functions with type checks are provided in the package.

## Usage

``` r
rs_gse_geom_elim(
  target_genes,
  levels,
  go_obj,
  gene_universe_length,
  min_genes,
  elim_threshold,
  min_overlap,
  fdr_threshold
)
```

## Arguments

- target_genes:

  A character vector representing the target gene set.

- levels:

  A character vector representing the levels to iterate through. The
  order will be the one the iterations are happening in.

- go_obj:

  The gene_ontology_data S7 class. See
  [`gene_ontology_data()`](https://gregorlueg.github.io/bixverse/reference/gene_ontology_data.md).

- gene_universe_length:

  The length of the gene universe.

- min_genes:

  number of minimum genes for the gene ontology term to be tested.

- elim_threshold:

  p-value below which the elimination procedure shall be applied to the
  ancestors.

- min_overlap:

  Optional minimum overlap threshold.

- fdr_threshold:

  Optional fdr threshold.

## Value

A list containing:

- go_ids - The gene ontology identifier.

- pvals - The calculated odds ratios.

- odds_ratios - The calculated odds ratios.

- overlap - The size of the overlap.

- gene_set_lengths - The length of the gene sets.
