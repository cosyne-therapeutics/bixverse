# Batch correction with bixverse

## Intro

Batch effects are systematic technical differences between experimental
runs that can obscure genuine biological signal in single cell data.
When datasets from multiple experiments, technologies, or laboratories
are combined, cells tend to group by their source rather than by cell
type. Batch correction methods aim to remove these technical artefacts
whilst preserving biological variation.

`bixverse` provides three batch correction approaches, each with
different trade-offs:

- **fastMNN** ([Haghverdi, et al.,
  2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4091)) identifies mutual nearest
  neighbours across batches – pairs of cells from different batches that
  are each other’s closest match. Correction vectors are computed from
  these pairs and applied to align the embeddings. It is particularly
  effective when cell type composition differs across batches.

- **Harmony** ([Korsunsky, et al.,
  2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0619-0)) operates on PCA
  embeddings using iterative soft clustering with diversity penalties.
  It assigns cells to clusters, estimates batch effects per cluster via
  ridge regression, and corrects the embedding. It tends to be fast and
  works well across a range of scenarios.

- **BBKNN** ([Polanski, et al.,
  2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz625)) takes a
  fundamentally different approach. Rather than correcting an embedding,
  it constructs a batch-balanced k-nearest neighbour graph by building
  separate neighbour indices per batch. The corrected graph can then be
  used directly for clustering and visualisation.

`bixverse` also provides three metrics for assessing batch correction
quality:

- **kBET**: tests whether neighbourhood batch proportions match global
  proportions (best for embedding-based methods).
- **Batch ASW**: measures batch separation in the embedding space (best
  for embedding-based methods).
- **LISI**: measures the effective number of batches per neighbourhood
  (works on any kNN graph).

``` r
library(bixverse)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Preparing the data

### Loading the batches

We use two PBMC datasets (pbmc3k and pbmc4k) as a standard benchmark for
batch correction. These come from the same tissue but differ in
sequencing depth and cell counts, introducing a clear batch effect.

``` r
dir_data <- download_pbmc_batches()

tempdir_batch_cor <- file.path(tempdir(), "batch_cor_bixverse")
dir.create(tempdir_batch_cor, showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)

h5ad_files <- list.files(dir_data)
h5ad_files <- h5ad_files[grepl(".h5ad", h5ad_files)]
h5ad_paths <- file.path(dir_data, h5ad_files)
names(h5ad_paths) <- c("pbmc3k", "pbmc4k")

h5_tasks <- prescan_h5ad_files(h5_paths = h5ad_paths)

sc_object <- SingleCells(dir_data = tempdir_batch_cor)

sc_object <- load_multi_h5ad(
  object = sc_object,
  prescan_result = h5_tasks,
  .verbose = TRUE
)
#> Loading observation data from h5ad files into DuckDB.
#> Loading variable data into DuckDB.
```

### Quality control

Before batch correction, we filter out low-quality cells using
mitochondrial gene proportions and library complexity metrics.

``` r
var <- get_sc_var(sc_object)

gs_of_interest <- list(
  MT = var[grepl("^MT-", symbol_tenx), gene_id],
  Ribo = var[grepl("^RPS|^RPL", symbol_tenx), gene_id]
)

sc_object <- gene_set_proportions_sc(
  sc_object,
  gs_of_interest,
  streaming = FALSE,
  .verbose = TRUE
)

qc_df <- sc_object[[c("cell_id", "lib_size", "nnz", "MT")]]

metrics <- list(
  log10_lib_size = log10(qc_df$lib_size),
  log10_nnz = log10(qc_df$nnz),
  MT = qc_df$MT
)
directions <- c(
  log10_lib_size = "twosided",
  log10_nnz = "twosided",
  MT = "above"
)

qc <- run_cell_qc(metrics, directions, threshold = 3)

qc
#> CellQc: 7040 cells, 1199 outliers (17.0%)
#> Metrics:
#>   - log10_lib_size: 450 outliers [lower = 3.07, upper = 3.93]
#>   - log10_nnz: 483 outliers [lower = 2.71, upper = 3.34]
#>   - MT: 728 outliers [upper = 0.05]
```

Let’s plot the metrics:

``` r
plots <- plot(qc, qc_df)

plots$log10_lib_size + plots$log10_nnz + plots$MT
```

![](single_cell_batch_corrections_files/figure-html/qc%20plots-1.png)

Set the cells to keep

``` r
sc_object[["outlier"]] <- qc$combined
cells_to_keep <- qc_df[!qc$combined, cell_id]
sc_object <- set_cells_to_keep(sc_object, cells_to_keep)
```

### Pre-processing

Standard pre-processing: HVG selection, PCA, and neighbour computation.

``` r
sc_object <- find_hvg_sc(
  object = sc_object,
  hvg_no = 2000L,
  .verbose = TRUE
)

sc_object <- calculate_pca_sc(
  object = sc_object,
  no_pcs = 30L
)
#> Using dense SVD solving on scaled data on 2000 HVG.

sc_object <- find_neighbours_sc(
  object = sc_object,
  neighbours_params = params_sc_neighbours(
    knn = list(knn_method = "exhaustive")
  )
)
#> 
#> Generating sNN graph (full: FALSE).
#> Transforming sNN data to igraph.
```

## Comparing the different methods

Let’s check out the different methods and how they behave.

### Uncorrected data

Before applying any correction, we can visualise the batch effect and
compute baseline metrics.

``` r
sc_object <- tsne_sc(object = sc_object)
#> Running t-SNE.
#> Using provided kNN graph.

tsne_dt_pre <- as.data.table(
  get_embedding(sc_object, "tsne"),
  keep.rownames = "cell_id"
)[, batch := sc_object[["sample"]]]
```

tSNE plot (tSNE’s usually look prettier… It’s anyway not a good way to
assess batch effect correction, so at least let’s make it pleasant on
the eye).

``` r
ggplot(tsne_dt_pre, aes(x = tsne_1, y = tsne_2)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = as.factor(batch)), alpha = 0.5, size = 0.5) +
  labs(
    x = "tSNE1",
    y = "tSNE2",
    title = "Before batch correction",
    colour = "Batch:"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

![](single_cell_batch_corrections_files/figure-html/uncorrected%20plot-1.png)

Batch correction stats:

``` r
kbet_score_prior <- calculate_kbet_sc(sc_object, batch_column = "sample")
asw_score_prior <- calculate_batch_asw_sc(sc_object, batch_column = "sample")
lisi_score_prior <- calculate_batch_lisi_sc(sc_object, batch_column = "sample")

kbet_score_prior
#> kBET Scores
#>   Cells: 5841 | Batches: 2 | Threshold: 0.050
#>   Rejection rate:      0.9882 (5772 / 5841)
#>   Mean Chi-Square:     12.8160 (expected under H0: 1)
#>   Median Chi-Square:   8.7578
asw_score_prior
#> Batch Silhouette Width
#>   Cells: 5000 | Batches: 2
#>   Mean ASW:    0.1103 (0 = perfect mixing, 1 = separated)
#>   Median ASW:  0.1213
lisi_score_prior
#> Batch LISI Scores
#>   Cells: 5841 | Batches: 2
#>   Mean LISI:    1.0130 (1 = no mixing, 2 = perfect mixing)
#>   Median LISI:  1.0000
```

The high kBET rejection rate and mean chi-square well above the expected
value of 1 confirm a substantial batch effect. LISI scores also indicate
very poor batch matching and the tSNE shows clear separation by batch.

### fastMNN

fastMNN works on batch-aware HVGs and produces a corrected embedding. It
identifies mutual nearest neighbours across batches to compute
correction vectors. For it to work best, we need the batch-aware HVGs.
We will calculate these, provide them to fastMNN (which regenerates the
PCA embedding based on the batch-aware HVG) and run then the actual
algorithm

``` r
batch_aware_hvg <- find_hvg_batch_aware_sc(
  object = sc_object,
  batch_column = "sample"
)

sc_object <- fast_mnn_sc(
  object = sc_object,
  batch_hvg_genes = batch_aware_hvg$hvg_genes,
  batch_column = "sample"
)

sc_object <- find_neighbours_sc(
  object = sc_object,
  embd_to_use = "mnn",
  neighbours_params = params_sc_neighbours(
    knn = list(knn_method = "exhaustive")
  )
)
#> 
#> Generating sNN graph (full: FALSE).
#> Transforming sNN data to igraph.
```

``` r
kbet_score_post_mnn <- calculate_kbet_sc(
  sc_object,
  batch_column = "sample"
)
asw_score_post_mnn <- calculate_batch_asw_sc(
  sc_object,
  embd_to_use = "mnn",
  batch_column = "sample"
)
lisi_score_post_mnn <- calculate_batch_lisi_sc(
  sc_object,
  batch_column = "sample"
)

kbet_score_post_mnn
#> kBET Scores
#>   Cells: 5841 | Batches: 2 | Threshold: 0.050
#>   Rejection rate:      0.3487 (2037 / 5841)
#>   Mean Chi-Square:     3.5882 (expected under H0: 1)
#>   Median Chi-Square:   3.6444
asw_score_post_mnn
#> Batch Silhouette Width
#>   Cells: 5000 | Batches: 2
#>   Mean ASW:    0.0186 (0 = perfect mixing, 1 = separated)
#>   Median ASW:  0.0428
lisi_score_post_mnn
#> Batch LISI Scores
#>   Cells: 5841 | Batches: 2
#>   Mean LISI:    1.4454 (1 = no mixing, 2 = perfect mixing)
#>   Median LISI:  1.4706
```

We can see clear improvements across all scores. Lower kBET scores,
better mean AWS scores and LISI scores also closer to 2 (i.e., number of
batches).

``` r
sc_object <- tsne_sc(object = sc_object)
#> Running t-SNE.
#> Using provided kNN graph.

tsne_dt_mnn <- as.data.table(
  get_embedding(sc_object, "tsne"),
  keep.rownames = "cell_id"
)[, batch := sc_object[["sample"]]]
```

``` r
ggplot(tsne_dt_mnn, aes(x = tsne_1, y = tsne_2)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = as.factor(batch)), alpha = 0.5, size = 0.5) +
  labs(
    x = "tSNE1",
    y = "tSNE2",
    title = "fastMNN batch correction",
    colour = "Batch:"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

![](single_cell_batch_corrections_files/figure-html/fastmnn%20plot-1.png)

Also, visually the batches get mixed now.

### Harmony

Harmony operates on the PCA embedding directly. The number of clusters
is auto-determined from the dataset size (capped at 200) when left as
`NULL`.

``` r
sc_object <- harmony_sc(
  object = sc_object,
  batch_column = "sample",
  harmony_params = params_sc_harmony()
)
#>  Auto-determined number of Harmony clusters: 195

sc_object <- find_neighbours_sc(
  object = sc_object,
  embd_to_use = "harmony",
  neighbours_params = params_sc_neighbours(
    knn = list(knn_method = "exhaustive")
  )
)
#> 
#> Generating sNN graph (full: FALSE).
#> Transforming sNN data to igraph.
```

Let’s calculate the batch correction-related scores

``` r
kbet_score_post_harmony <- calculate_kbet_sc(
  sc_object,
  batch_column = "sample"
)
asw_score_post_harmony <- calculate_batch_asw_sc(
  sc_object,
  embd_to_use = "harmony",
  batch_column = "sample"
)
lisi_score_post_harmony <- calculate_batch_lisi_sc(
  sc_object,
  batch_column = "sample"
)

kbet_score_post_harmony
#> kBET Scores
#>   Cells: 5841 | Batches: 2 | Threshold: 0.050
#>   Rejection rate:      0.1481 (865 / 5841)
#>   Mean Chi-Square:     2.1294 (expected under H0: 1)
#>   Median Chi-Square:   1.5425
asw_score_post_harmony
#> Batch Silhouette Width
#>   Cells: 5000 | Batches: 2
#>   Mean ASW:    0.0201 (0 = perfect mixing, 1 = separated)
#>   Median ASW:  0.0353
lisi_score_post_harmony
#> Batch LISI Scores
#>   Cells: 5841 | Batches: 2
#>   Mean LISI:    1.5908 (1 = no mixing, 2 = perfect mixing)
#>   Median LISI:  1.6423
```

Also here, we observe improvements across the board.

``` r
sc_object <- tsne_sc(object = sc_object)
#> Running t-SNE.
#> Using provided kNN graph.

tsne_dt_harmony <- as.data.table(
  get_embedding(sc_object, "tsne"),
  keep.rownames = "cell_id"
)[, batch := sc_object[["sample"]]]
```

``` r
ggplot(tsne_dt_harmony, aes(x = tsne_1, y = tsne_2)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = as.factor(batch)), alpha = 0.5, size = 0.5) +
  labs(
    x = "tSNE1",
    y = "tSNE2",
    title = "Harmony batch correction",
    colour = "Batch:"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

![](single_cell_batch_corrections_files/figure-html/harmony%20plot-1.png)

### BBKNN

BBKNN constructs a batch-balanced kNN graph rather than correcting an
embedding. The key parameter is `neighbours_within_batch`, which
controls how many neighbours are found per batch. Setting
`no_neighbours_to_keep` below the total generated neighbours (here 10
from 2 batches = 20 total) ensures the distance-based filtering
introduces genuine variation, making downstream metrics informative.

Note that kBET and ASW are not well suited for evaluating BBKNN: kBET
compares neighbourhood proportions against global proportions, which
BBKNN manipulates by design, and ASW requires an embedding. LISI on the
stored kNN is the most appropriate metric here.

``` r
sc_object <- bbknn_sc(
  object = sc_object,
  batch_column = "sample",
  no_neighbours_to_keep = 15L,
  bbknn_params = params_sc_bbknn(neighbours_within_batch = 10L)
)
#> Warning in `method(bbknn_sc, bixverse::SingleCells)`(object = <object>, : Prior
#> kNN matrix found. Will be overwritten.
#> Running BBKNN algorithm.
#> Generating graph based on BBKNN connectivities. Weights will be based on the connectivities and not shared nearest neighbour calculations.
```

``` r
kbet_score_post_bbknn <- calculate_kbet_sc(
  sc_object,
  batch_column = "sample"
)
lisi_score_post_bbknn <- calculate_batch_lisi_sc(
  sc_object,
  batch_column = "sample"
)

kbet_score_post_bbknn
#> kBET Scores
#>   Cells: 5841 | Batches: 2 | Threshold: 0.050
#>   Rejection rate:      0.0000 (0 / 5841)
#>   Mean Chi-Square:     3.1228 (expected under H0: 1)
#>   Median Chi-Square:   3.1228
lisi_score_post_bbknn
#> Batch LISI Scores
#>   Cells: 5841 | Batches: 2
#>   Mean LISI:    1.7999 (1 = no mixing, 2 = perfect mixing)
#>   Median LISI:  1.8000
```

``` r
sc_object <- tsne_sc(object = sc_object)
#> Running t-SNE.
#> Using provided kNN graph.

tsne_dt_bbknn <- as.data.table(
  get_embedding(sc_object, "tsne"),
  keep.rownames = "cell_id"
)[, batch := sc_object[["sample"]]]
```

``` r
ggplot(tsne_dt_bbknn, aes(x = tsne_1, y = tsne_2)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = as.factor(batch)), alpha = 0.5, size = 0.5) +
  labs(
    x = "tSNE1",
    y = "tSNE2",
    title = "BBKNN batch correction",
    colour = "Batch:"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Choosing a method

There is no universally best batch correction method. Some practical
guidance:

- **Harmony** is a good default. It is fast, operates on the PCA
  embedding directly, and handles multiple batch variables
  simultaneously. It tends to work well when batch effects are moderate
  and cell type composition is broadly similar across batches.

- **fastMNN** is worth considering when cell type composition differs
  substantially across batches. The mutual nearest neighbour approach is
  less sensitive to this because it only aligns cells that have a
  plausible biological match in another batch.

- **BBKNN** is useful when you want to avoid modifying the embedding at
  all. The batch-balanced graph can be passed directly to graph-based
  clustering algorithms. It is the lightest-touch approach but provides
  less control over the degree of correction.

In practice, running multiple methods and looking at quantitative
metrics is the most reliable approach. No single metric captures
everything – kBET and ASW measure different aspects of embedding-based
correction, and LISI is most informative for graph-based methods. UMAPs
and tSNE assessments should be taken with a big pinch of salt, see
[Chari, et
al.](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011288).
Admittedly, they do look pretty however.

## Clean up

``` r
unlink(tempdir_batch_cor, recursive = TRUE, force = TRUE)
```
