# Doublet detection with bixverse

## Intro

Doublets - droplets containing two or more cells - are a common artefact
in droplet-based single cell experiments. If left undetected, they
masquerade as intermediate cell states or novel populations and quietly
corrupt downstream analyses. This vignette demonstrates two doublet
detection approaches available in `bixverse` and benchmarks them against
ground truth calls from [demuxlet](https://github.com/statgen/demuxlet),
which identifies doublets via genetic variation across pooled donors.

`bixverse` provides two computational doublet detection methods:

- **Scrublet** is a simulation-based approach ([Wolock, et al.,
  2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.11.005)). It generates
  synthetic doublets by averaging pairs of randomly selected cells,
  embeds both real and synthetic cells together, and scores each real
  cell by the proportion of its nearest neighbours that are synthetic. A
  bimodal score distribution is expected: singlets cluster near zero,
  doublets near one. A threshold on this score determines the final
  calls.

- **Boosted doublet detection** takes a different angle. Rather than
  simulating doublets, it trains a gradient-boosted tree ensemble to
  distinguish real cells from synthetic doublets generated in the same
  way as Scrublet. The classifier produces a probability per cell, and
  doublet calls are derived from that probability. This can be more
  robust when the score distribution from Scrublet is not cleanly
  bimodal, though it introduces its own hyperparameters (and is slower).

Both methods are purely computational and work without genetic or
hashing information. They complement experimental approaches like
demuxlet, which require pooled donors or hashtag antibodies. They also
have a failure mode if a large number of doublets dominates the original
data.

``` r
library(bixverse)
library(data.table)
```

## Loading the data

We use a PBMC data set with demuxlet ground truth calls. The demuxlet
output classifies each barcode as a singlet (`SNG`) or doublet (`DBL`)
(or ambiguous, but irrelevant for this situation), giving us something
to benchmark against.

``` r
doublet_path <- download_demuxlet_pbmc()

tempdir_doublet <- file.path(tempdir(), "demuxlet_bixverse")
dir.create(tempdir_doublet, showWarnings = FALSE, recursive = TRUE)

demuxlet_data <- fread(file.path(doublet_path, "demuxlet_calls.tsv"))

table(demuxlet_data$Call)
#> 
#>   AMB   DBL   SNG 
#>    24  1565 13030
```

Load in the data into bixverse

``` r
sc_object <- SingleCells(dir_data = tempdir_doublet)

mtx_io_params <- get_cell_ranger_params(doublet_path)
mtx_io_params$cells_as_rows <- TRUE

sc_object <- load_mtx(
  object = sc_object,
  sc_mtx_io_param = mtx_io_params
)
#> Loading observations data from flat file into the DuckDB.
#> Loading variable data from flat file into the DuckDB.

sc_object
#> Single cell experiment (Single Cells).
#>   No cells (original): 14528
#>    To keep n: 14528
#>   No genes: 12622
#>   HVG calculated: FALSE
#>   PCA calculated: FALSE
#>   Other embeddings: none
#>   KNN generated: FALSE
#>   SNN generated: FALSE
```

We also define a small helper to compute precision, recall and F1
against the demuxlet calls.

``` r
doublet_metrics <- function(
  predicted,
  actual,
  pos_predicted = TRUE,
  pos_actual = "DBL"
) {
  tp <- sum(predicted == pos_predicted & actual == pos_actual)
  fp <- sum(predicted == pos_predicted & actual != pos_actual)
  fn <- sum(predicted != pos_predicted & actual == pos_actual)
  precision <- tp / (tp + fp)
  recall <- tp / (tp + fn)
  f1 <- 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
  list(precision = precision, recall = recall, f1 = f1)
}
```

## Doublet detection methods

Let’s check the two methods out and see how they behave

### Scrublet

``` r
scrublet <- scrublet_sc(
  object = sc_object,
  scrublet_params = params_scrublet(
    expected_doublet_rate = 0.1
  )
)

scrublet
#> ScrubletRes: 14528 cells, 1754 doublets (12.1%)
#>   Threshold:              0.1852
#>   Detected doublet rate:  12.1%
#>   Detectable fraction:    87.3%
#>   Overall doublet rate:   13.8%
#>   Simulated doublets:     21792
```

The `plot` method shows the score distribution for observed and
simulated cells. A clean separation between the two modes indicates the
threshold is sensible.

``` r
plot(scrublet)
```

![](doublet_detection_files/figure-html/scrublet%20plot-1.png)

How does the automatic thresholding perform against the demuxlet ground
truth?

``` r
scrublet_dt <- get_obs_data(scrublet)
scrublet_dt[, Barcode := get_cell_names(sc_object)]
scrublet_dt <- merge(scrublet_dt, demuxlet_data, by = "Barcode")

doublet_metrics(predicted = scrublet_dt$doublet, actual = scrublet_dt$Call)
#> $precision
#> [1] 0.6641961
#> 
#> $recall
#> [1] 0.7472739
#> 
#> $f1
#> [1] 0.7032901
```

#### Manual threshold adjustment

The automatic threshold does not always land in the right place. If the
score distribution suggests a different cut-off, `call_doublets_manual`
lets you override it.

``` r
scrublet_adj <- call_doublets_manual(scrublet, threshold = 0.25)
#> Detected doublet rate = 10.0%
#> Estimated detectable doublet fraction = 80.4%
#> Overall doublet rate:
#>   Estimated = 12.4%

plot(scrublet_adj)
```

![](doublet_detection_files/figure-html/scrublet%20manual%20threshold-1.png)

``` r
scrublet_adj_dt <- get_obs_data(scrublet_adj)
scrublet_adj_dt[, Barcode := get_cell_names(sc_object)]
scrublet_adj_dt <- merge(scrublet_adj_dt, demuxlet_data, by = "Barcode")

doublet_metrics(
  predicted = scrublet_adj_dt$doublet,
  actual = scrublet_adj_dt$Call
)
#> $precision
#> [1] 0.7019364
#> 
#> $recall
#> [1] 0.6510584
#> 
#> $f1
#> [1] 0.6755408
```

We have made it worse here, but maybe there are cases where the scores
are not very good. Compared to the original version, Otsu’s method is
used to identify the perfect threshold, but it might fail in some
situations.

### Boosted doublet detection

The boosted approach trains a classifier to separate real cells from
synthetic doublets. This can work better when the Scrublet score
distribution is messy or unimodal. However, in this case we are running
25 iterations of the algorithm, which means 25x generation of synthetic
doublets, re-normalisation, PCA, kNN, Louvain, classification. This
makes this slower. We will be using `"nndescent"`, one of the
implemented kNN algorithms that can be faster at this data set size.

``` r
boosted_doublets <- doublet_detection_boost_sc(
  object = sc_object,
  boost_params = params_boost(knn = list(knn_method = "nndescent"))
)

boosted_doublets
#> BoostRes: 14528 cells, 1243 doublets (8.6%)
#>   Score range: [0.0041, 0.7300]
```

Let’s check how boosted works?

``` r
boosted_dt <- get_obs_data(boosted_doublets)
boosted_dt[, Barcode := get_cell_names(sc_object)]
boosted_dt <- merge(boosted_dt, demuxlet_data, by = "Barcode")

doublet_metrics(predicted = boosted_dt$doublet, actual = boosted_dt$Call)
#> $precision
#> [1] 0.7039421
#> 
#> $recall
#> [1] 0.5612572
#> 
#> $f1
#> [1] 0.6245539
```

### Conclusion

Both methods can help to identify in a data-driven way doublets in your
data. In this example, Scrublet performed better compared to boosted
doublet detection, but you will have to see which one does better on
your data. It can be worth running both and compare scores, expected
doublet detections, etc. A longer idea will be to implement additionally
also [scDblFinder](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9204188/).
